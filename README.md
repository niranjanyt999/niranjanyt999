#About Me
Hi! I'm Niranjan Kumar, an Electrical Engineering student with a deep passion for technology and innovation. My journey into the world of engineering started with a curiosity about how things work, leading me to explore the fascinating world of circuits, coding, and problem-solving.

#My Expertise
While pursuing my degree, I developed a strong interest in JavaScript and its ability to create dynamic, interactive web applications. I enjoy writing clean, efficient code and constantly improving my skills to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

#My Goal
My ultimate aim is to become the best engineer I can beâ€”one who not only excels in electrical engineering but also masters cutting-edge programming skills to build innovative solutions.

#Beyond Engineering
When Iâ€™m not coding or working on engineering projects, youâ€™ll often find me enjoying video games like Free Fire. Gaming is my way of unwinding and staying sharp with quick decision-making skills!

#Letâ€™s Connect!
Iâ€™m always eager to learn, collaborate, and connect with like-minded individuals. Feel free to reach out to discuss technology, projects, or even gaming!
